	* A signal room.
	* <p>
	* The signal room is a communication connection point. Object can observ
	* signal on the room or can dispatch signals into the room. Inside a signal
	* room is it possible to use multiple types of signal protocols. The signal
	* protocol is the definitions how to react on signals. So can be implement
	* a data transfer without that the sender and receiver has references
	* from each others. Also is it imaginatable that a protocol is implement
	* via more than 2 objects with dynamic object switching, like it is defined
	* in the protocol.<br/>
	* If a sender will known, if a receiver object exists, so he can call the
	* <code>hasEventListener()</code> function with the protocol start event.
	* If a sender has to check or not, is depend of the implementation situation.
	* </p>
