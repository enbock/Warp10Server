CppDoc Example Scripts

ex1-simple: basic command-line call, using the default cppdoc-standard module.

ex2-hier:   generates output from the old (cppdoc-old) module, with a
            hierarchical class index.

ex3-custom: demonstrates the use of custom header and footer, with separate
            index pages for each letter and with deprecations disabled.

ex4-custom: creates a custom index with all documentation, using files for
            the header, footer, and per-item, and linking to a website for the
            source-file links.  Uses the cppdoc-old module.

ex5-auto:   same as ex1, but with auto-quit and auto-view (of the HTML).


*** Note that you can generate a command line in CppDoc by choosing "Generate
    Command Line..." from the system menu (the menu with "Close", "Minimize",
    etc.).
